1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

Simply put, The Gaming Room is a game developer that is trying to create and release their game "Draw It or Lose It". This game would hopefully be developed on a desktop OS and then transition to the mobile market where it can be experienced by iOS and Android users.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think my insight and specification on minor details were really emphasized in this document. Behind the words, I feel as though the throught process was taken from a place of understanding of the product, as well as the process.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

That parts and sections of the document were due at different time periods. This game room for the later sections to truly be refined and polished.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would pick the chart because i think that more could be explained about all the individual cells that asdsociate to each OS. A lot of the information that would be needed though would have to be in a more document format rather than cell by cell chart.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I take ideas from products that work and see how they can format to this specific task. Most if not all companies for example, use two factor authentication for security. Something that functions like that I take into consideration and se how that would work on this product. That is a very niche and specific example but I think it gets the point across.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approach it as if itt were a puzzle: one step at a time. Any project can seem overwelming at face value, thats why its important to take baby steps every step of the way so that the work doesn't sem difficult and the time doesn't seem too straining.  In the future I would like to use more development tools that are specific to the OS or system that the product will be used on, such as Android's "App Inventor". Maybe not use the extent of the tool(s) to finalize the product, but use the tool as a building block in developing in your own way.  See what works, and visualize how you can build off of what works / improve it.
